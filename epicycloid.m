function []=epicycloid(r,k,cycles)

%% This will trace a hypotrochoid with the given constants
%% r, and k, with R=k*r (which control the shape of the curve)
%% 'cycles' controls how many cycles of the sine and cosine
%% waves will be plotted. 'cycles' only makes a difference
%% when r, R, and/or k are non-integer.

%% The actual parameter is t

t=[0:.01:cycles*2*pi];

R=k*r;
x=((R+r)*cos(t))-(r*cos(((R+r)/r)*t));
y=((R+r)*sin(t))-(r*sin(((R+r)/r)*t));
z=r*cos((R/r)*t);

s=sprintf('The Epicyloid, R=%d, r=%d, k=%d, cycles=%d',R,r,k,cycles);

%% (2 marks)
%% Part 1: TO DO:
%%
%% Starting at 0, and progressing to cycles*2*pi at
%% intervals of .05, compute the tangent vector
%% for the curve using the equations you derived.
%%
%% Each tangent vector will be stored as a row
%% in an array for later use, and we'll
%% plot them on the curve so you can see if 
%% they are reasonable.
%% 
%% Complete the code below to obtain the tangent
%% vectors.
%%
%% IN THE SAME FOR LOOP, but commented out
%% until you have the tangent vectors: 
%%
%% TO DO:
%%
%% (4 marks)
%% Part 2:
%%
%% We want to turn the epicycloid curve into a funky 
%% tube-shape we will draw
%% a small circle, perpendicular to the curve, at 
%% each location on the curve. 
%%
%% We need to find the tangent plane at each point,
%% but all we have is a tangent vector.
%%
%% In the space below, complete code to obtain the
%% tangent plant at each point in the curve. Note
%% that we need 2 orthogonal, unit vectors on this
%% plane in order to be able to draw the circles.
%% 
%% These vectors will be stored in arrays called
%% u_vec, and v_vec. Much like the tangents 
%% array above.
%%
%% HINT: The tangent vector is orthogonal to these
%% two. Also, we solved a similar problem when
%% setting up a camera's coordinate frame vectors
%% u, v, and w!

  %% Determine the current point [xa, ya, za] on the hypotrochoid

  za=r*cos((R/r)*i);                            % parametric equations!
  
  %% Part 1 code goes just below these comments!
  %% Compute tx, ty, and tz, the components of
  %% the tangent vector

  tx=-(R+r)*sin(i)+r*sin(((R+r)/r)*i)*((R+r/r));
  ty=(R+r)*cos(i)-r*cos(((R+r)/r)*i)*(((R+r)/r));         % DUMMY VECTOR, replace with correct one. 
  tz=-r*sin((R/r)*i)*(R/r);
  
  tangents(end+1,:)=[tx ty tz];

  line([xa xa+(.02*tx)],[ya ya+(.02*ty)],[za za+(.02*tz)],'color',[1 0 0],'linewidth',2.5);

  %% IF you computed the tangent vectors correctly, you should see little red lines that
  %% align with the blue curve, these cover a pair of curve points.
  %% If the lines do not align with the blue curve, something went wrong, 
  %% and you should have a second look at your computations above.

  %%%% PART 2 code goes just below these comments - YOU NEED TANGENT VECTORS
  %%%% for this to work so right now this is commented out. Uncomment the
  %%%% code below when you're ready to work on this part.
  
  t = [tx ty tz];
  t = t / norm(t);
  up = [0 0 1];
  v = cross(t,up)/norm(cross(t,up));
  u = cross(t,v);
%  	% Let's plot a parametric circle using these vectors.
%  	% it they are correct, you should get circles that
%  	% are perpendicular to the curve at each of the points
%  	% where we computed a tangent vector.
%      % To do this, we're using a parametric circle
%      %
%      %   C(t)=v*cos(t) + u*sin(t), t in [0, 2*pi]
%      %
%      % and since the circle is centered at point p
%      % on the curve, we have:
%      %
%      %   C(t)=p + v*cos(t) + u*sin(t), t in [0, 2*pi]
%      %
%      % It looks weird below because I'm using Matlab
%      % operators to get all points in one go without 
%      % using loops, but I'm just evaluating the
%      % equation above! (yes, really!).cl
